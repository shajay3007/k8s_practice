Automated Deletion of Services
Task: Developed a script to automate the deletion of unused or obsolete services.
Details:
Designed using Python and Shell scripting to identify and remove services based on predefined criteria (e.g., inactivity, redundancy).
Ensures that the environment remains optimized by reducing clutter and freeing up resources.
Outcome:
Reduced manual intervention and potential errors in service deletion.
Improved system performance and resource utilization by eliminating unused services.
Key Achievements
Enhanced operational efficiency with automation for service cleanup.
Minimized risks of human error in managing critical services.
Contributed to maintaining a streamlined and well-organized
